<ConceptDesign>
This is a concept design style repo.

Important: Do not modify any existing concept Doc objects (ie. ArticleDoc) under the concepts folder. Do not add fields (ie. paywall) to existing concept Docs (ie. ArticleDoc in article.ts)
Do not import concepts into other concept files ever (ie. do not import TagConcept into ArticleConcept). Do not import any 
concept from app into any other concept (ie. do not import Account from app into ArticleConcept).

To create API messages, you may have to invoke multiple concepts and merge them together using the Merge class.

Please add new endpoints to the routes.ts file.
